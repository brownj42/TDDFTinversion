# Python wrapper implementation

To compile you may need to change the LIBS line in the Makefile.

An example script is [tddft_test.py](tddft_test.py).

For different examples from the paper, there are separate scripts
Example_1.py 1 particle, 1 dimension separating wavepack on harmonic oscillator
Example_2.py 1 particle, 3 dimensions bilinearly coupled harmonic oscillator potential
Example_3.py 2 particles, 1 dimension, driven wavepacket from ground state
Example_4.py 5 partiles, 1 dimension, spin system with 15 lattice points
